            "text/markdown": "Dear Bijan,\n\nThank you for reaching out with your query about setting up a Crew and adding memory to it. I'm here to provide you with comprehensive guidance on this matter.\n\nTo set up a Crew and add memory to it, you can follow the steps outlined in the CrewAI documentation, specifically in the \"Assembling and Activating Your CrewAI Team\" section. Here is a summary of the steps you need to take:\n\n1. Installation: Install CrewAI and any necessary packages for your project. Ensure compatibility with Python >=3.10, <=3.13.\n   - Command: \n     ```\n     pip install crewai\n     pip install 'crewai[tools]'\n     ```\n\n2. Assemble Your Agents: Define your agents with distinct roles, backstories, and capabilities like memory usage.\n   - Example code snippet:\n     ```\n     from crewai import Agent\n     # Creating a senior researcher agent with memory and verbose mode\n     researcher = Agent(\n         role='Senior Researcher',\n         goal='Uncover groundbreaking technologies in {topic}',\n         verbose=True,\n         memory=True,\n         backstory=\"Driven by curiosity, you're at the forefront of innovation...\",\n         tools=[search_tool],\n         allow_delegation=True\n     )\n     ```\n\n3. Define the Tasks: Detail specific objectives for your agents with memory and output customization.\n   - Example code snippet:\n     ```\n     from crewai import Task\n     # Research task\n     research_task = Task(\n         description=\"Identify the next big trend in {topic}...\",\n         expected_output='A comprehensive 3 paragraphs long report on the latest AI trends.',\n         tools=[search_tool],\n         agent=researcher,\n     )\n     ```\n\n4. Form the Crew: Combine your agents into a crew with memory and enhanced configurations for task execution.\n   - Example code snippet:\n     ```\n     from crewai import Crew, Process\n     # Forming the tech-focused crew with enhanced configurations\n     crew = Crew(\n         agents=[researcher, writer],\n         tasks=[research_task, write_task],\n         process=Process.sequential,\n         memory=True,\n         cache=True,\n         max_rpm=100,\n         share_crew=True\n     )\n     ```\n\n5. Kick It Off: Initiate the task execution process with your enhanced crew ready for collaboration.\n   - Example command:\n     ```\n     result = crew.kickoff(inputs={'topic': 'AI in healthcare'})\n     print(result)\n     ```\n\nUtilizing Memory Capabilities in Crew Task Execution and Collaboration:\n\nMemory in the Crew platform is crucial for optimizing task execution and collaboration. Here's how memory capabilities are utilized:\n1. Task Execution: Memory stores task-related data for quick access and efficient execution. It also caches data for faster processing.\n2. Collaboration: Memory facilitates real-time collaboration, storing and updating task information for seamless team interaction.\n\nBy following these steps and understanding how memory is used in task execution and collaboration, you can successfully set up a Crew with memory capabilities. If you need further assistance or clarification on any step, feel free to reach out to us.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\nSenior Support Representative\ncrewAI"
